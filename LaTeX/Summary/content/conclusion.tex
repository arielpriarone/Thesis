\section{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK}

The proposed solution has been proven effective in performing Novelty Detection in both public datasets and laboratory tests. The flexibility of the framework allows it to be easily adapted to different systems. 

Some tests have shown that the standardization of the features is not always enough to make the clusters in the data space meaningful. In this case, in the PC implementation, Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor Models, being not cluster-based, have been tested and resulted as more effective. As future work, the deployment of these models on the Edge implementation would bring a significant improvement in the performance of the framework in some specific applications.
