\chapter{Proposed Framework}
\label{ch:Framework}

In the \autoref{ch:FeatureExtraction} the features extraction process has been described. Before approaching the problem of performing \gls{nd} in \gls{glo:edge}, let's build a framework in \texttt{python} that runs on a \gls{pc} that is \emph{configurable}, \emph{modular}, \emph{expandable} and \emph{general purpose}. This framework will be used to test the features extraction process and to test the \gls{ml} algorithms before selecting one of them to be implemented \gls{glo:edge} framework, which will be harder to configure.

A real case application would probably have several signals of several physical quantities, so a general approach that can manage different types of features, and extract from each of them the most relevant information, is needed.

The proposed framework is thought to be set up on any type and combination of sensors. The framework is thought to manage data that are correlated to a specific fault. For example, think about a \gls{cnc} machine like the one in \autoref{fig:cnc}. It has five axes, so a solution would be to instance the framework five times, one for each axis, linked to vibration sensors, temperature sensors etc. of the considered axis. This would allow us to pinpoint the fault to a specific axis. Another concern is, what if the single axis is seeing a normal condition, but the machine as a whole is not? This may happen if the tool has a problem: the vibration registered in the spindle would be normal in general, but would not be normal \emph{related} to the feed rate that another axis is imposing. To address this scenario, other instances of the framework can be set up, that also receive the speeds from the machine controller and the feed rate from the \gls{cnc} program as well as data from the sensors used in the other instances. This would allow us to detect a more complex fault, that is not characteristic of any part of the machine, but of the machine as a whole. The former kinds of instances would allow specific faults to be detected, giving also an idea of what the fault is, the latter would allow complex faults to be detected, but would not give a precise idea of what the fault is. The framework is thought to be able to manage both of these scenarios, and to be able to manage them together.
