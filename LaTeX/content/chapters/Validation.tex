\chapter{Validation}
\label{sec:Validation}

This chapter is dedicated to the validation of the framework on real-world data. In \autoref{ch:FeatureExtraction}, the reference dataset \cite{lee2007bearingdataset} has been introduced. Firstly, the \texttt{python} implementation of the framework is validated on the \gls{ims} dataset several times with different configurations to show the flexibility of the framework, and try to find the best configuration for the dataset. 

The first test in the \gls{ims} dataset is carried out with all the machine learning models developed, then only the K-mean model is used in the following tests. In all tests an outlier filter has been implemented, so that the \gls{mla} will warn about the novelty behavior only if two consecutive snapshots are labeled as outliers. 

Then, the \gls{glo:edge} implementation of the framework is validated experimentally on a machine and with a laboratory shaker.
