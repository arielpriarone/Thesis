\section{\gls{ims} dataset No.1 - All sensors}
In the previous section, an extensive test of the framework has been performed on a single signal from the dataset (Bearing 3 x). So the warning given by the \gls{mla} was indicating a problem in a specific component of the maintained system. Let's now test a configuration that takes in account all the signals of the dataset, so all the eight signals from the four bearings are used for feature extraction. This configuration should be able to detect a generic novel behaviout of the system or, better, a situaton in wich the sistem is abnormal as a whole (the signals may be normal but the combination of them may be abnormal).  In this case the configuration file has been set to use all the time-domain and all the frequency-domain features, and the \gls{mla} has been trained with the same procedure as before.
