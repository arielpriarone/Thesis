\section{Notations}
\label{sec:notations}
In this thesis, the following notations are used:
\begin{itemize}
  \item bold lowercase letters ($\vect{a}$, $\vect{b}$, $\vect{c}$) are used to denote vectors;
  \item italic lowercase letters ($a$, $b$, $c$) are used to denote scalars;
  \item bold uppercase letters ($\vect{A}$, $\vect{B}$, $\vect{C}$) are used to denote matrices;
  \item $\vect{a}_{i(j)}$ is the $j$th element of the vector $\vect{a}_i$;
  \item $||\vect{a}||_2$ is the $l^2$-norm of the vector $\vect{a}$, defined as $\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2}$, denoted also as $\norm{a}$ for simplicity;
  \item $||\vect{a}||_n$ is the generic $l^n$-norm of the vector $\vect{a}$, defined as $\sqrt[n]{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \abs{a_i}^n}$;
  \item parenthesis encapsulating an index are used to condense descriptions, for example \quoted{\textbf{$\vect{a}_{i(j)}$ is the force applied to the $i$th ($j$th) step}} means that $\vect{a}_i$ is the force applied to the $i$th step and $\vect{a}_j$ is the force applied to the $j$th step;
\end{itemize}

No distinction in notation is made between a vector in the phisycal sense (applied to a point, with a direction, and a magnitude) and a vector in the mathematical sense (a generic number $\in \mathbb{R}^n $).
