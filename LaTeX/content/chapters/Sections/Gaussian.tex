\section{Gaussian Mixture Model}
\label{sec:gaussian}
A Gaussian Mixture Model is a probabilistic model that assumes that the data are generated from a mixture of several gaussian distributions. Depending on the parameters of a Gaussian distributions (mean and variance) it the data generated from it will have a shape that resamble an elipsoid with a centre and a orientation.
