\section{Objective of the thesis}
\label{sec:objectives}

The goal of this thesis is to design, code and test an algorithm that will perform \gls{nd}, \gls{fd} and \gls{pdm}. This algorithm will be implemented twice:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  coding in \texttt{python} and running it on a \gls{pc};
    \item   coding in \texttt{C} and running it on a microcontroller.
\end{itemize}

To do that
