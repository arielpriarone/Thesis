We substantiate our points with extensive experiments, using clustering and outlier detection methods with and without index acceleration. We discuss what we can learn from evaluations, whether experiments are properly designed, and what kind of conclusions we should avoid. We close with some general recommendations but maintain that the design of fair and conclusive experiments will always remain a challenge for researchers and an integral part of the scientific endeavor.},

abstract = {K-Means algorithm is one of the famous partitioning clustering techniques that has been studied extensively. However, the major problem with this method that it cannot ensure the global optimum results due to the random selection of initial cluster centers. In this paper, we present a novel method that selects the initial cluster centers with the help of Voronoi diagram constructed from the given set of data points. The initial cluster centers are effectively selected from those points which lie on the boundary of higher radius Voronoi circles. As a result, the proposed method automates the selection of the initial cluster centers to supply them for K-means. The proposed method is experimented on various artificial (hand-made) as well as real world data sets of various dimensions. It is observed that it is able to produce better clustering results than the traditional K-means and the improved K-means.}

abstract = {In this paper we consider thek-clustering problem for a set S of n points i=(xi) in thed-dimensional space with variance-based errors as clustering criteria, motivated from the color quantization problem of computing a color lookup table for frame buffer display. As the inter-cluster criterion to minimize, the sum on intra-cluster errors over every cluster is used, and as the intra-cluster criterion of a cluster Sj,|Sj|α-1 ΣpiϵSj || xi - x(Sj)||2is considered, where ||·|| is the L2 norm and x(Sj) is the centroid of points in Sj, i.e., (1/|Sj|)Σp ∈Sjxi. The cases of α=1,2 correspond to the sum of squared errors and the all-pairs sum of squared errors, respectively.The k-clustering problem under the criterion with α=1,2 are treated in a unified manner by characterizing the optimum solution to the kclustering problem by the ordinary Euclidean Voronoi diagram and the weighted Voronoi diagram with both multiplicative and additive weights. With this framework, the problem is related to the generalized primary shutter function for the Voronoi diagrams. The primary shutter function is shown to be O(nO(kd)), which implies that, for fixed k, this clustering problem can be solved in a polynomial time. For the problem with the most typical intra-cluster criterion of the sum of squared errors, we also present an efficient randomized algorithm which, roughly speaking, finds an ∈–approximate 2–clustering in O(n(1/∈)d) time, which is quite practical and may be used to real large-scale problems such as the color quantization problem.},

abstract = {The k-means algorithm is by far the most widely used method for discovering clusters in data. We show how to accelerate it dramatically, while still always computing exactly the same result as the standard algorithm. The accelerated algorithm avoids unnecessary distance calculations by applying the triangle inequality in two different ways, and by keeping track of lower and upper bounds for distances between points and centers. Experiments show that the new algorithm is effective for datasets with up to 1000 dimensions, and becomes more and more effective as the number k of clusters increases. For k ≥ 20 it is many times faster than the best previously known accelerated k-means method.},

SVM have been shown to provide high classification accuracies and have good generalization capabilities. SVM can classify linearly separable data as well as nonlinearly separable data through the use of the kernel function. The advantages of using SVM are discussed along with the standard types of kernel functions. Furthermore, the effectiveness of applying SVM to large, spatial datasets derived from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is also described. Future trends and applications are also discussed – the described extracted dataset contains seven independent variables related to urban development plus a class label which denotes the urban areas versus the rural areas. This large dataset, with over a million instances really proves the generalization capabilities of the SVM methods. Also, the spatial property allows experts to analyze the error signal.},

Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},

abstract = {De-noising and extraction of the weak signature are crucial to fault prognostics in which case features are often very weak and masked by noise. The wavelet transform has been widely used in signal de-noising due to its extraordinary time-frequency representation capability. In this paper, the performance of wavelet decomposition-based de-noising and wavelet filter-based de-noising methods are compared based on signals from mechanical defects. The comparison result reveals that wavelet filter is more suitable and reliable to detect a weak signature of mechanical impulse-like defect signals, whereas the wavelet decomposition de-noising method can achieve satisfactory results on smooth signal detection. In order to select optimal parameters for the wavelet filter, a two-step optimization process is proposed. Minimal Shannon entropy is used to optimize the Morlet wavelet shape factor. A periodicity detection method based on singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to choose the appropriate scale for the wavelet transform. The signal de-noising results from both simulated signals and experimental data are presented and both support the proposed method.}

ABSTRACT = {Prognostic Health Management (PHM) is a predictive maintenance strategy, which is based on Condition Monitoring (CM) data and aims to predict the future states of machinery. The existing literature reports the PHM at two levels: methodological and applicative. From the methodological point of view, there are many publications and standards of a PHM system design. From the applicative point of view, many papers address the improvement of techniques adopted for realizing PHM tasks without covering the whole process. In these cases, most applications rely on a large amount of historical data to train models for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Industries, very often, are not able to obtain these data. Thus, the most adopted approaches, based on batch and off-line analysis, cannot be adopted. In this paper, we present a novel framework and architecture that support the initial application of PHM from the machinery producers’ perspective. The proposed framework is based on an edge-cloud infrastructure that allows performing streaming analysis at the edge to reduce the quantity of the data to store in permanent memory, to know the health status of the machinery at any point in time, and to discover novel and anomalous behaviors. The collection of the data from multiple machines into a cloud server allows training more accurate diagnostic and prognostic models using a higher amount of data, whose results will serve to predict the health status in real-time at the edge. The so-built PHM system would allow industries to monitor and supervise a machinery network placed in different locations and can thus bring several benefits to both machinery producers and users. After a brief literature review of signal processing, feature extraction, diagnostics, and prognostics, including incremental and semi-supervised approaches for anomaly and novelty detection applied to data streams, a case study is presented. It was conducted on data collected from a test rig and shows the potential of the proposed framework in terms of the ability to detect changes in the operating conditions and abrupt faults and storage memory saving. The outcomes of our work, as well as its major novel aspect, is the design of a framework for a PHM system based on specific requirements that directly originate from the industrial field, together with indications on which techniques can be adopted to achieve such goals.},
