abstract={In recent times, the Internet of Things and big data analytics have become a hot research topic in mobile edge computing (MEC) desires wide-ranging research works for intelligent decision making. In this view, this paper designs an intelligent outlier detection with machine learning empowered big data analytics (IODML-BDA) for MEC. The proposed model involves an adaptive synthetic sampling-based outlier detection technique to eradicate the existence of outliers. Besides, the oppositional swallow swarm optimization (OSSO) based feature selection technique is used to choose an effective set of features. Finally, long short-term memory based classification model is employed to identify different class labels. The design of OSSO algorithm for feature selection with ADASYN technique for big data analytics show the novelty of the work. A comprehensive experimental analysis is carried out on GPS trajectories, movement prediction, water treatment plant, hepatitis, and Twitter datasets to confirm the experimental results. The experimentation outcomes pointed out that the proposed IODML-BDA model achieves the higher accuracy of 0.9735, 0.9816, 0.9798, 0.9896, and 0.9912 on the applied datasets.},
