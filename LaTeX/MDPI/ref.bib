abstract={In recent times, the Internet of Things and big data analytics have become a hot research topic in mobile edge computing (MEC) desires wide-ranging research works for intelligent decision making. In this view, this paper designs an intelligent outlier detection with machine learning empowered big data analytics (IODML-BDA) for MEC. The proposed model involves an adaptive synthetic sampling-based outlier detection technique to eradicate the existence of outliers. Besides, the oppositional swallow swarm optimization (OSSO) based feature selection technique is used to choose an effective set of features. Finally, long short-term memory based classification model is employed to identify different class labels. The design of OSSO algorithm for feature selection with ADASYN technique for big data analytics show the novelty of the work. A comprehensive experimental analysis is carried out on GPS trajectories, movement prediction, water treatment plant, hepatitis, and Twitter datasets to confirm the experimental results. The experimentation outcomes pointed out that the proposed IODML-BDA model achieves the higher accuracy of 0.9735, 0.9816, 0.9798, 0.9896, and 0.9912 on the applied datasets.},

abstract={Timely failure detection for bearings is of great importance to prevent economic losses in the industry. In this article we propose a method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to estimate the level of wear in roller bearings in each of its elements, inner race, outer race and rolling element. First of all, an automatic labeling of the raw vibration data for each element of the bearing is performed to obtain different levels of wear, by means of the Root-Mean-Square features along with the Shannon's entropy to extract features from the raw data, which is then grouped in different classes using the K-means algorithm to obtain the labels for seventeen levels of degradation condition. Then, the raw vibration data is converted into small square images, each point of the data representing one pixel of the image. Following this, we propose a CNN model based on the AlexNet architecture to classify the wear level and diagnose the rotating system. To train the network and validate our proposal, we use a dataset from the center of Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS), and extensively compare it with other methods reported in the literature. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy proved to be excellent compared to other approaches in the state of the art.},
