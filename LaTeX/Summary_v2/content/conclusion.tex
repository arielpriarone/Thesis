\section{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK}

The proposed solution has been proven effective in performing Novelty Detection in both public datasets and laboratory tests. The flexibility of the framework allows it to be easily adapted to different systems. 

Some laboratory tests on the Edge implementation have shown that the standardization of the features is not always enough to make the clusters in the feature space meaningful. When this happened, in the PC implementation, Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor Models, being not cluster-based, were tested and resulted as more effective. As future work, the deployment of these models also in the Edge implementation would improve the performance of the framework in some specific applications.
